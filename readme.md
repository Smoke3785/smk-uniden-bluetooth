This is a WIP library to interface with Uniden Radar Detector Devices.

It works at the moment, but support for the R9 is limited.

The internal API and the WS/REST servers are being developed. Once they're approaching completion, documentation will be added.

I will also be adding a tutorial on what configuration options are necessary to make this demo work with your device.
